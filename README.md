These are the verilog projects I have been working on, while in undergrad school.
The FPGA development borad that I have been using is the Basys 3 board.
In each project file includes the source code, and some include testbench codes.

---------------- Verilog_BASYS3_Projects ---------------------------------------------------------------
The folders include the verilog files that I have implemented, from reading: Digital System Design with FPGA, by CEM UNSALAN & BORA TAR. Here you can find how to implement systems using I2C, UART, SPI, etc.
---------------- Verilog_BASYS3_Projects ---------------------------------------------------------------

---------------- Verilog_Ping_Pong_Project--------------------------------------------------------------
The folders include the verilog files that are required for transmitting though a VGA connector along with the top module to simulate the Pong game. One player will use the buttons BTNR and BTND to move the paddle up and down respectively. The Other player will use the buttons BTNU and BTNL to move the paddle up and down respectly. The score board will be displayed on the 4 7-segment display, where the left 2 didgits represent Player 1's score and the right 2 digits represent Player 2's score.
